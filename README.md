# LinkMe
Managing all my different links across platforms like GitHub, my portfolio, and social media used to be such a hassle. Every time I updated something, I had to go through *every* platform and change the link manually. And let's be real—it’s super easy to miss one, and then you’ve got that annoying broken link just sitting there, waiting for someone to click it. Ugh!

So, I thought, why not create a solution for myself? And boom—this project was born! Now, I’ve got a central hub where I can manage all my links in one place. Instead of updating everything separately, I just update one spot and share a single link everywhere. For example, when I share `linkme.com/myproject`, it always sends people to the right place, no matter how many times the original link changes. *How cool is that?*

But this isn’t just about convenience—it’s about peace of mind. No more stressing about broken links hiding out on the internet! Plus, it’s been really fun building something that solves a problem I’ve dealt with for so long.

**PEACE ✌️**
