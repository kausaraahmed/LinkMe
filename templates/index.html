            <p>I've always found it difficult to manage all my different links across various platforms. I have
                projects on GitHub, a portfolio site, and social media profiles, and they're all interconnected. The
                problem is, every time I update a link, I have to go through every platform and make sure it's changed
                everywhere. It's easy to miss one, and then that broken link just sits there, waiting for someone to
                click on it. <br> <br>

                So, I decided to create a simple solution for myselfâ€”a central hub where I can store and manage all my
                links. Instead of manually updating every single place, I can now just update them in one spot, and
                share a single link everywhere. For example, if I share "linkme.com/myproject," it will always redirect
                to the correct place, no matter how many times the original link changes. <br> <br>

                This project isn't just about making my life easier; it's about having more control and peace of mind,
                knowing that I won't accidentally leave broken links scattered across the web. Plus, it's kind of fun to
                build something useful that scratches an itch I've had for a long time! <br> <br>

                <b>PEACE</b>
